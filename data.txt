Chess
The opening is the first part of the game, roughly the first ten moves or so.
In the opening, it's a good idea to do threee things- bring out your bishops
and knights, try to control the center of the board, and castle your king.
（国际象棋的第一个阶段是开局，大致是前10步左右。在开局阶段，最好做三件事情：
将象和马调出来；努力控制棋盘的中间区域；用车将王护住。）
	Of course, these are just guidelines. It will be important to learn when
to follow these guidelines and when to disregard these suggestions.（当然，这
些只是指导原则。学习什么情况下遵守这些原则、什么情况下不用遵守很重要。）

In the opening phase of the game, it's important to bring out your bishops 
and knights. These pieces are powerful and maneuverable enough to play a 
significnat role in the beginning moves of a game.（在国际象棋的开局阶段，将
象和马调出来很重要。这些棋子威力大，机动性强，在开局阶段扮演者重要角色。）
	
Entry
One of the most important concepts in climbing is to keep your weight on your feet as much as possible. There's a myth that climbers can hang all day on their arms. In reality, good climbers have practiced specific ways of keeping their weight over their feet whenever possible.（最重要的攀岩概念之一是尽可能让双脚承受体重。有谬误认为攀岩者能依靠手臂的力量坚持一整天。实际上，优秀的攀岩者都经过专门的训练，能够尽可能让双脚承受体重。）
